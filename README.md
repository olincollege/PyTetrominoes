# PyTetrominoes
A Python game with Tetrominoes by CJ Hilty & Daniel Park.

## Overview

“PyTetrominoes” is a game with the same rules and mechanics as the classic 1984 Tetris Game. We recreated this game to familiarize ourselves with Pygame, the library we built our game upon, and the Model-View-Contoller (MVC) framework.

The word "PyTetrominoes" is a Portmanteau word, or a blend of the two words, “Python”, the language we programmed this in, and “Tetrominoes,” the name of our block. For information about the rules of Tetris, please visit the [official Tetris Fandom Website](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline) for the official rules we based our game on.

However, unlike normal Tetris, PyTetrominoes takes a different approach to the atmosphere to the game. Instead of blocks falling faster and faster in Tetris, the speed of the game remains constant. We added lofi music, and we used a blackboard theme to try and achieve a vibe that ‘you’re learning to play tetris in a less stressful environment’.

## Libraries and Packages

Please making sure you have [Python 3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-python-on-windows) and [pip](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows) already downloaded before running these commands. Instructions for installation are hyperlinked to the libraries.

Our game is built using Pygame, a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. To install the package, run the following command in Bash:

`$ pip install pygame`
