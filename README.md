# PyTetrominoes

A Python game with Tetrominoes by CJ Hilty & Daniel Park.

## Overview

“PyTetrominoes” is a game with the same rules and mechanics as the classic 1984 Tetris Game. For information about the rules of Tetris, please visit the [official Tetris Fandom Website](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline) for the official rules we based our game on.

"PyTetrominoes" is a Portmanteau word, or a blend of the two words, “Python”, the language we programmed this in, and “Tetrominoes,” the name of our block.
