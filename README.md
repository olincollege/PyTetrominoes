# PyTetrominoes
A Python game with Tetrominoes by [CJ Hilty](https://github.com/cjhi) & [Daniel Park](https://github.com/DanPark13).

## Overview

“PyTetrominoes” is a game with the same rules and mechanics as the classic 1984 Tetris Game. We recreated this game to familiarize ourselves with Pygame, the library we built our game upon, and the Model-View-Contoller (MVC) framework.

The word "PyTetrominoes" is a Portmanteau word, or a blend of the two words, “Python”, the language we programmed this in, and “Tetrominoes,” the name of our block. For information about the rules of Tetris, please visit the [official Tetris Fandom Website](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline) for the official rules we based our game on.

However, unlike normal Tetris, PyTetrominoes takes a different approach to the atmosphere to the game. Instead of blocks falling faster and faster in Tetris, the speed of the game remains constant. We added lofi music, and we used a blackboard theme to try and achieve a vibe that ‘you’re learning to play tetris in a less stressful environment’.

## Screenshots & Demonstrations

When the user first opens the game, the game will start with the first block falling down in the Tetris board. The game will proceed as normal Tetris (with a few altercations mentioned in the __Overview__ section.

Users will keep playing the game until the board gets filled to the brim with pieces, which then the "Game Over" Screen will show and users can start the game over by pressing the "Enter" button on their keyboard.
