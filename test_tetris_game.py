"""
Test that the view and game management functions work properly.
"""

# Unit tests for the functions in the tetris_game.py file require an
# interactive form of testing like mock patch or event injection. We have
# verified that the game's view functions work with the game in an error-free
# way, and that the functions it calls run properly.
